### Overview

This second project in WDI **building a full-stack application.** Here I would be  **building a Rails app**, where I have  created the  flow of the end user can Log In to the app and create his own recipe and upload it along with getting some inspiration from other users who have categorised their recipe

**This is exciting!**
my target group would be any one who wishes to join in the 'CooK BooK' app for the passion they hold of cooking and share their own creativity 

The app was designed keeping in mind that young professional would get to learn new skills from chef who have been in the industry for many years and their willingness to share their knowledge by creating innovative dishes which he best local produce in the market and as per seasonality.

my aim to the app was creating something very simple which any one could use but yet look elegant 

First 2 days of my project i spent in planning my app models and relationship between them as it was very important to make sure that the relationship is clear and in a good flow 

I also designed my framework during that time it is been attached to my Project in Balsamiq. Where the complete flow of the App is specified 

I personally feel that i have met with all the requirements given to complete the app and the feeling of  complexity was also achieved with my work

There were few places in the app where i have used my creativity to a point of my understanding to make the look of the app more elegant, and give it my personal spin with the video on the Home page

I have also learnt the skills of deployment of my project on heroku

**The flow of the project is**


A user comes on the app

He comes across the home page which allows him to Sign in or Register.

He will then be taken to the respective pages

If the user logs in or register  it would be routed to the users show page 

At users show page the user can create /edit or destroy his own recipes that he would have created if he is a new user he would then be able to add on new recipes by pressing the key on the nav bar which would only show up on log in
 
If he does choose to add a recipe he would then be taken to the Create page of the recipe where he can add his data in and upload (multiple) images and that would then be displayed on the user show page 

Same way a user can also edit his user show page (profile page)if wishes to do so.
In this app i have also got a message service where  2 users can share their knowledge or views or comments about the recipe with the creator for feedback purpose that can be visited with the key on the nave bar "Messages".
